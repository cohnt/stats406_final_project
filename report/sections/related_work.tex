In their paper \textit{Manifold Learning for Multivariate Variable-Length Sequences With an Application to Similarity Search},~\cite{ho2015manifold} present several similarity measures for variable length data sequences, and apply them to manifold learning on Hurricanes.
This will provide the basis for one of our predictive methods for the path a hurricane will take, and whether or not it will make landfall.
