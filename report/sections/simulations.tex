In order to generate more data from the limited real-world data available, I plan to add noise using various methods to existing data.
One method I will consider is simply adding Gaussian noise to each point in a track.
I will also generate random walks of the same length, and then add them pointwise to the hurricane.
I will analyze how realistic the data generated by these methods are, and use the larger dataset to examine the quality of my estimators.
