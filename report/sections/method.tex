\subsection{Number of Storms}

\par
We will attempt to find the distributions which best fit the data on number of storms based on various loss functions.
Note that the number of landfalling storms is discrete.
The distributions I plan to examine include
\begin{itemize}
	\item Poisson
	\item Negative Binomial
\end{itemize}
For loss functions, I will examine common examples such as the 0-1 and quadratic loss functions, as well as defining some specific loss functions that make sense in the context of hurricanes.
