This section will largely need to be written after I have results.

I imagine that one major takeaway from my project will be the fact that historical and generated data alone don't do a great job of modeling hurricanes.
I expect to see many outliers, and that the predictions may not be reliable to the degree needed for weather forecasting.
The incorporation of weather models, and the inclusion of larger scale weather patterns such as El Ni\~{n}o, could likely provide much more accurate results, and would be an interesting direction for future research.

\par
I will also mention the fact that larger scale changes in weather patterns, due to global warming, may present some skew in the results.
It would be helpful to take this into account while trying to fit probability distributions to hurricane data.
