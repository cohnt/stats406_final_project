A hurricane is one of the most destructive weather events in the United States.
Every fall, major storms threaten states along the Gulf Coast and Atlantic ocean with high winds, heavy rain, and storm surge.
Some hurricanes proceed to make landfall, causing significant damage to life and property, while others avoid land altogether, having almost zero human impact.
So understandably, the modeling and prediction of Atlantic hurricanes is an important topic of study.

I will begin by attempting to describe an accurate probability distribution for the number of tropical storms in a given year, and the number of landfalling storms. We will consider both multiple parametric distributions, and compare to a nonparametric distribution.
Next, I will compare several methods for predicting whether a hurricane will make landfall, and under what circumstances, based on information from the formation and early life of the storm.
Finally, I will examine the frequency of outlier hurricanes, to analyze how common unexpected or unpredicted events are.
