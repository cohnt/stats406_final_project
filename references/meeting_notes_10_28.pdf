*Formatting*
IEEE 2-column conference-style okay?
Related Work section?

*Content*
Focus on prediction versus finding historical trends?
Prediction ideas:
	- Model and predict stats by year (number of hurricanes, landfalls, etc.)
	- Predict individual hurricanes (manifold learning/closest historical hurricane, predict landfall)
Historical trends:
	- Number of hurricanes, landfalls, etc. per year. Model individual years and examine larger trend
Ideas that apply to both:
	- Compare various parametric distributions (including maybe mixture of Gaussians?) with a nonparametric distribution
	- Outlier analysis (intensity, longevity, size, track)


ANSWERS

Prediction is much more interesting
Compare different distributions (including parametric vs nonparametric), loss functions, etc.
	Really focus on loss function
How rare are outliers? Think of how skinny the tails are, especially Cauchy vs Normal
My formatting stuff works.
